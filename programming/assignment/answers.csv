Q1.1
Job, Salary, Education Requirements
Data Scientists, 112,000, "Bachelor's at least"
Computer Research Scientist, 140,000, "Master's"
Information Security Analyst, 124,000, "Bachelors"
Software Developers, 131,000, "Bachelors"
Computer Network Architects, 130,000, "Bachelors"
Computer Systems Analysts, 103,000, "Bachelors"
Database Administrator & Architects, 123,000, "Bachelors"

Q1.2 
I'm surprised to see that Data Scientists are paid so little. This job usually requires at least a Bachelors, but most jobs require a relevant Masters or Doctorate degree. 
However, this makes less than all but one other job listed, all having the same or lower education requirements. 

Q1.3 
1. Software Developer (most general and available job with good pay)
2. Computer Network Architects (creativity in architecture and design process) 
3. Computer Research Scientist (allowance for exploration of interesting and unexplored topics)
4. Information Security Analyst (would be interesting to analyze and test the vulnerabilities in software)
5. Data Scientist (creativity in deriving insights from data)
6. Computer Systems Analyst (seems like a broad job, how would you know you're doing well)
7. Database Admin & Architect (seems like an automatable job, many services are available for automatic telemetry & monitoring of databases)
